# Creating custom Filters for datasets/single items

## Objectives

- Write a custom filter
- Implement a custom filter on ng-repeat
- Implement a custom filter on a single expression

## Instructions

In this repo we've got a massive list of contacts repeated in a table.

You might've noticed all of the names are in lowercase - this doesn't look great.

1. Create a custom filter to change the first letter of the word to be in uppercase, and apply this to the persons names.

2. Create a custom filter that allows us to filter on the contacts list that only displays contacts from the city that we pass in.
