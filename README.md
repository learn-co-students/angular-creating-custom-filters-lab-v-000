# Creating custom Filters for datasets/single items

## Objectives

- Write a custom filter
- Implement a custom filter on ng-repeat
- Implement a custom filter on a single expression

## Instructions

In this repo we've got a massive list of contacts repeated in a table.

You might've noticed all of the names are in lowercase â€” this doesn't look great.

1. Create a custom filter to capitalize the first letter of each name.
2. Create another custom filter that allows us to filter the contact list by city. We should be able to pass in the name of a city as an argument and receive a filtered list displaying only contacts from that city.
